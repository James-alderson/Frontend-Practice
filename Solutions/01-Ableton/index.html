        <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for what

        <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from
          a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of
          us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and
          knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

          strive to make them great.</h2>
        <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic
          and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and
          thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but
          opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

        <p>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and
          skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music
          salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>

          you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s
          not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun,
